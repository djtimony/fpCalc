Free calculators for financial products

Why is this site here? 
First, it's a hobby of mine. Every day there are new financial products on the market and technology changes just as rapidly
behind it. To keep up with ever changing industries like this, building out web sites would seem like a good way to keep both
technology and financial skills fresh! 

Second, during my career on Wall Street, it seems God has blessed me with a talent for breaking down the most complex of
problems. It's always been about simplicity for me. Financial products are not complicated if you understand how to break 
them down into the right components. Once financial products are broken down into components, each Component can then be 
understood, dealt with and technology and business solutions become much more clear. This site will demonstrate this 
breakdown by building calculators and financial tools based on a series of data segments. Each data segment is mutually 
exclusive, but all bind together to make a financial product whole. Behind each of these calculators is a datamodel that 
follows the same concepts.

 
Third, I've searched the web for decent derivative calculators and haven't found one yet that gives the same or similar 
functionality, flexibility and transparency as the ones used by Wall Street traders. Got tired of searching, so I'm building
them! 

Why use fpcalc.com? For starters ...  ITS FREE!!
That's right, you are all benefiting from my wanting to stay on top of my skills! These are not amateur calculators, 
they are the culmination of my experience with financial product vendors, sitting with traders and quants and working 
with back office, risk, compliance and technology at investment houses, asset management firms and hedge funds. None of 
what you will see on this site is at all proprietary, everything can be found in finance journals and other periodicals 
that focus on financial products. All I did was to provide one site where you can use these calculators and toolkits and 
gain transparency to the underlying data to understand what is really going on !

Lastly ... Its Fun and a Financial Sand Box!
For the beginner, the goal would be to provide transparency to help familiarize you with financial products along with 
the data and calculations that go into making them up. Hopefully you will find this site easy enough to use and begin to
understand how the components work together to form a financial product. For the more experienced, the goal would be that
you would use the calculators and toolkits provided to help you validate trading decisions, perhaps provide a benchmark to
a model you are developing, understand the risk of existing holdings or use the market data calculators to help provide 
better transparency.
